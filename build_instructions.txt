# ðŸš€ Build Instructions - Highway Dash

These are the steps to generate a Windows executable (.exe) for the game using PyInstaller.

---

## 1. Install PyInstaller

Make sure you are inside your virtual environment (if using one), then run:

    pip install pyinstaller

---

## 2. Build the executable

Navigate to the folder where your `main.py` is located:

    cd src

Now run:

    pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole main.py

- `--onefile`: Generates a single .exe file.
- `--noconsole`: Prevents a black terminal window from opening when the game starts.

This will create a `dist/` folder containing `main.exe`.

---

## 3. Copy your assets

PyInstaller does **not** bundle image/sound files by default.

You must manually copy the entire `assets/` folder (with all subfolders) to the same directory where the `.exe` file is.

Example structure:

    dist/
    â”œâ”€â”€ main.exe
    â””â”€â”€ assets/
        â”œâ”€â”€ images/
        â””â”€â”€ sounds/

Make sure the folder structure matches what your game expects.

---

## 4. Run the game

Double-click `main.exe` inside `dist/` to play your compiled game.

---

## 5. Optional: Clean up build files

You can delete the `build/` and `__pycache__/` folders if you want to reduce clutter.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

- All sound/image file paths in your code must be relative (e.g., `assets/images/...`)
- If you're having issues, try running the `.exe` via CMD to see error messages.

Happy building! ðŸš—ðŸ’¨
